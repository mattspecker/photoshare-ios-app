# 📱 PhotoShare Auto-Upload - Current Status & Next Steps

**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Status**: iOS app working, debugging photo upload issue

## 🎯 **Current Issue**
- Auto-upload system is working (authentication ✅, settings ✅, dashboard ✅)
- User has enabled auto-upload for event: `bd1935c5-b9ad-4aad-96d7-96f3db0e551c`
- Dashboard shows "Enabled Events: 1" after manual fix
- **BUT**: No photos are being uploaded because iOS photo library access isn't properly implemented

## 🔧 **Problem Discovered**
- `Camera.getPhotos()` is **NOT implemented on iOS** in Capacitor
- Current photo monitoring code doesn't actually access iOS photo library
- Need to implement proper iOS photo library access

## ✅ **What's Working**
1. **Authentication**: User logged in successfully to photo-share.app
2. **Settings Service**: Can enable/disable events, stores settings locally
3. **Dashboard**: Shows real-time status via 3-finger tap or shake
4. **Upload Service**: Ready to process photos when provided
5. **Real-time Sync**: Infrastructure ready for web ↔ mobile sync

## 📋 **Files Created for Website Integration**
Location: `/Users/mattspecker/Documents/appProjects/photoshare_app/iOSapp2/www/`

1. **photoshare-auth-bridge.js** - Authentication integration
2. **photoshare-auto-upload-bundle.js** - Main auto-upload system
3. **photoshare-event-detector.js** - Event detection and toggle UI
4. **photoshare-realtime-sync.js** - Real-time sync with useAutoUploadSync hook

## 🌐 **Website Integration**
Add to photo-share.app HTML (before closing `</body>`):
```html
<script src="/js/photoshare-auth-bridge.js"></script>
<script src="/js/photoshare-auto-upload-bundle.js"></script>
<script src="/js/photoshare-event-detector.js"></script>
<script src="/js/photoshare-realtime-sync.js"></script>
```

## 📊 **Debug Commands Available**
```javascript
// Show dashboard
showDashboard()

// Check enabled events
window.PhotoShareAutoUpload.settingsService.getEnabledEvents()

// Enable event manually
window.PhotoShareAutoUpload.settingsService.enableAutoUploadForEvent("EVENT_ID")

// Check authentication
window.PhotoShareAutoUpload.authService.getCurrentUser()

// Check system status
window.PhotoShareAutoUpload.getStatus()
```

## 🔄 **Real-Time Sync Integration**
- Created integration with existing `useAutoUploadSync` hook
- Connects to `event_participants` table
- Bidirectional sync: mobile ↔ web
- Uses `update_auto_upload_settings` RPC function

## 🚧 **Next Steps to Fix Photo Upload**

### **Option 1: Manual Photo Upload Interface (Immediate)**
- Create floating "📤 Upload Photos" button when auto-upload is enabled
- Use `Camera.getPhoto()` to let users select photos from library
- Queue selected photos for upload to enabled events

### **Option 2: Proper iOS Photo Library Access (Complete Solution)**
- Implement native iOS photo library monitoring
- Use `PHPhotoLibrary` framework via custom Capacitor plugin
- Automatically detect new photos during event timeframes

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
- Start with manual upload interface for immediate functionality
- Add automatic monitoring in future update

## 🔍 **Current Debug Session**
- User URL: `https://photo-share.app/event/bd1935c5-b9ad-4aad-96d7-96f3db0e551c`
- Event ID: `bd1935c5-b9ad-4aad-96d7-96f3db0e551c`
- Fixed: `getEnabledEvents()` now returns `["bd1935c5-b9ad-4aad-96d7-96f3db0e551c"]`
- Issue: Photo monitoring says "looking for photos" but `Camera.getPhotos()` not implemented

## 📱 **iOS Photo Library Permissions**
Already configured in `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>PhotoShare needs photo library access to select and share photos.</string>
```

## 🛠️ **Implementation Notes**
- iOS app redirects directly to photo-share.app
- All auto-upload functionality must work on live website
- Cannot modify website without additional tokens
- All debugging must be done via console commands

## 💡 **Immediate Fix Strategy**
1. **Add manual photo upload interface** to current system
2. **Use `Camera.getPhoto()`** with `source: CameraSource.Photos`
3. **Show floating upload button** when events are enabled
4. **Let users select photos manually** from library
5. **Queue photos for upload** to enabled events

## 🎯 **Expected User Flow**
1. User enables auto-upload for event ✅
2. Floating "📤 Upload Photos" button appears
3. User taps button to select photos from library
4. Photos get uploaded to enabled event
5. Upload progress shown in dashboard

## 📊 **Success Metrics**
- [ ] Photo library permissions granted
- [ ] Manual photo selection working
- [ ] Photos successfully uploaded to backend
- [ ] Upload progress visible in dashboard
- [ ] Real-time sync with web interface

## 🔧 **Code Changes Needed**
- Modify `PhotoMonitor.checkForNewPhotos()` to create manual interface
- Add `Camera.getPhoto()` integration for iOS photo selection
- Implement floating upload button when events enabled
- Add upload progress notifications

## 📞 **Key Contacts/Resources**
- Backend: `event_participants` table with auto-upload columns
- Hook: `useAutoUploadSync` for real-time web integration
- API: `update_auto_upload_settings` RPC function
- Upload endpoint: `/functions/v1/mobile-upload`

## 🚀 **Platform Roadmap**
- ✅ **iOS**: Core system complete, photo access needs fix
- 📋 **Android**: Ready for implementation using same codebase
- ✅ **Web**: Dashboard and controls integrated
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Single JavaScript bundle approach

---

**Resume Point**: Fix iOS photo library access by implementing manual photo selection interface using `Camera.getPhoto()` with photo library source.
