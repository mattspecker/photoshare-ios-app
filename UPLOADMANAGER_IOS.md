‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useUploadManager.js         # React hook for upload management
```

### **Integration with EventPhotoPicker**
```swift
// In EventPhotoPicker.swift - handlePhotoSelection method
private func handlePhotoSelection(call: CAPPluginCall, selectedPhotos: [EventPhoto]) {
    // Process photos as before...
    
    // After processing, automatically queue for upload
    let uploadManager = UploadManager()
    uploadManager.queuePhotos([
        "photos": processedPhotos,
        "eventId": eventId,
        "eventName": eventName,
        "priority": "high"
    ])
    
    call.resolve([
        "photos": processedPhotos,
        "count": processedPhotos.count,
        "uploadQueued": true
    ])
}
```

### **Swift Plugin Implementation Pattern**
```swift
@objc(UploadManager)
public class UploadManager: CAPPlugin {
    private var uploadQueue: UploadQueue?
    private var apiClient: PhotoShareApiClient?
    private var progressTracker: UploadProgressTracker?
    
    override public func load() {
        super.load()
        setupUploadManager()
    }
    
    @objc func uploadPhotos(_ call: CAPPluginCall) {
        // Real implementation - no fake data
        guard let photos = call.getArray("photos") else {
            call.reject("No photos provided")
            return
        }
        
        // Queue photos for upload
        queuePhotosForUpload(photos, call: call)
    }
    
    @objc func getUploadStatus(_ call: CAPPluginCall) {
        // Return real upload queue status
        let status = uploadQueue?.getStatus() ?? [:]
        call.resolve(status)
    }
    
    @objc func getUploadedPhotoHashes(_ call: CAPPluginCall) {
        // Return real uploaded photo hashes for duplicate detection
        let hashes = uploadQueue?.getUploadedHashes() ?? []
        call.resolve(["hashes": hashes])
    }
}
```

### **JavaScript API Design**
```javascript
// UploadManager JavaScript Interface
const UploadManager = window.CapacitorPlugins.UploadManager;

// Queue photos for upload
await UploadManager.uploadPhotos({
  photos: selectedPhotos,
  eventId: 'event-123',
  eventName: 'Birthday Party',
  priority: 'high'
});

// Monitor upload progress
UploadManager.addListener('uploadProgress', (data) => {
  console.log(`Upload ${data.taskId}: ${data.progress}% (${data.speed} KB/s)`);
});

UploadManager.addListener('uploadComplete', (data) => {
  console.log(`Upload completed: ${data.taskId}`);
});

UploadManager.addListener('uploadFailed', (data) => {
  console.error(`Upload failed: ${data.taskId} - ${data.error}`);
});

// Get upload status
const status = await UploadManager.getUploadStatus();
// Returns: { pending: 3, uploading: 1, completed: 15, failed: 2 }

// Get uploaded photo hashes for duplicate detection
const hashes = await UploadManager.getUploadedPhotoHashes({
  eventId: 'event-123'
});
```

## üîó PhotoShare API Integration

### **Mobile Upload Edge Function**
**Endpoint**: `/supabase/functions/mobile-upload`
**Method**: POST
**Authentication**: JWT Bearer token

```javascript
// Request Format
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
  Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body:
  file: <binary_data>
  eventId: "event-uuid-123"
  metadata: {
    originalName: "IMG_001.jpg",
    dateTaken: 1692025200000,
    fileSize: 2048576,
    sha256Hash: "abc123...def789",
    deviceInfo: { model: "iPhone 15", os: "iOS 17" }
  }

// Response Format
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    photoId: "photo-uuid-123",
    url: "https://cdn.photo-share.app/photos/photo-uuid-123.jpg",
    thumbnailUrl: "https://cdn.photo-share.app/thumbnails/photo-uuid-123.jpg",
    sha256Hash: "abc123...def789",
    isDuplicate: false
  }
}
```

### **Duplicate Detection Flow**
1. **Compute SHA-256** hash of selected photo using native iOS APIs
2. **Check against uploaded hashes** from previous uploads stored locally
3. **Query server** for hash existence if not found locally
4. **Mark as uploaded** if hash exists, skip upload
5. **Proceed with upload** if hash is new
6. **Store hash locally** after successful upload for future checks

## üì± User Experience Flow

### **Happy Path: Photo Selection to Upload**
1. **User opens EventPhotoPicker** ‚Üí Automatically check uploaded photo hashes
2. **Mark uploaded photos** ‚Üí Gray out with checkmark, make unselectable
3. **User selects new photos** ‚Üí Only non-uploaded photos are selectable
4. **User confirms selection** ‚Üí Photos automatically queue for upload
5. **Background upload starts** ‚Üí Real-time progress notifications
6. **Upload completes** ‚Üí EventPhotoPicker updates to show uploaded status

### **Network Interruption Handling**
1. **Upload pauses** when network disconnects (real network monitoring)
2. **iOS monitors** network state changes automatically
3. **Upload resumes** when network returns with proper retry logic
4. **User receives notification** about network-dependent uploads

### **App Lifecycle Handling**
1. **Background uploads continue** using iOS background task API
2. **Upload queue persists** in UserDefaults/Core Data
3. **Uploads resume** when app returns to foreground
4. **Progress recovers** accurately from last known state

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### **Test Scenario 1: Basic Upload Flow**
1. **Open EventPhotoPicker** ‚Üí Select 3 new photos
2. **Verify auto-queue** ‚Üí Photos should queue automatically
3. **Monitor progress** ‚Üí Real progress updates should appear
4. **Verify completion** ‚Üí Photos should appear in PhotoShare event
5. **Reopen picker** ‚Üí Photos should show as uploaded

### **Test Scenario 2: Duplicate Detection**
1. **Upload 2 photos** ‚Üí Wait for completion
2. **Reopen EventPhotoPicker** ‚Üí Photos should be marked as uploaded
3. **Try selecting same photos** ‚Üí Should be unselectable
4. **Select 1 new + 1 duplicate** ‚Üí Only new photo should queue
5. **Verify behavior** ‚Üí No duplicate upload, proper status display

### **Test Scenario 3: Network Interruption**
1. **Start uploading 5 photos** ‚Üí Disable WiFi mid-upload
2. **Verify pause behavior** ‚Üí Uploads should pause gracefully
3. **Re-enable network** ‚Üí Uploads should resume automatically
4. **Monitor progress** ‚Üí Should continue from where it left off
5. **Verify completion** ‚Üí All photos should upload successfully

### **Test Scenario 4: App Lifecycle**

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION NOTES & TROUBLESHOOTING

### **EventPhotoPicker Plugin Registration Issues (RESOLVED)**

**Problem:** EventPhotoPicker plugin was not being registered properly in iOS, causing "EventPhotoPicker not available after 10 seconds" errors.

**Root Cause:** Missing Objective-C bridge files (.m files) required for Capacitor plugin registration in iOS.

**Solution Steps:**
1. **Created Objective-C bridge files** for all custom plugins:
   ```bash
   # EventPhotoPicker.m
   #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
   #import <Capacitor/Capacitor.h>
   
   CAP_PLUGIN(EventPhotoPicker, "EventPhotoPicker",
              CAP_PLUGIN_METHOD(openEventPhotoPicker, CAPPluginReturnPromise);
              CAP_PLUGIN_METHOD(openRegularPhotoPicker, CAPPluginReturnPromise);
              CAP_PLUGIN_METHOD(getEventPhotosMetadata, CAPPluginReturnPromise);
              CAP_PLUGIN_METHOD(showEventInfo, CAPPluginReturnPromise);
   )
   
   # UploadManager.m  
   CAP_PLUGIN(UploadManager, "UploadManager",
              CAP_PLUGIN_METHOD(uploadPhotos, CAPPluginReturnPromise);
              CAP_PLUGIN_METHOD(getUploadStatus, CAPPluginReturnPromise);
              CAP_PLUGIN_METHOD(getUploadedPhotoHashes, CAPPluginReturnPromise);
   )
   
   # PhotoLibraryMonitor.m
   CAP_PLUGIN(PhotoLibraryMonitor, "PhotoLibraryMonitor",
              CAP_PLUGIN_METHOD(startMonitoring, CAPPluginReturnPromise);
              CAP_PLUGIN_METHOD(stopMonitoring, CAPPluginReturnPromise);
              CAP_PLUGIN_METHOD(getStatus, CAPPluginReturnPromise);
   )
   ```

2. **Updated capacitor.config.json** to include custom plugins in packageClassList:
   ```json
   "packageClassList": [
     "SignInWithApple",
     "BarcodeScanner", 
     "DatePickerPlugin",
     "PhotoViewerPlugin",
     "FirebaseAppPlugin",
     "FirebaseAuthenticationPlugin",
     "AppPlugin",
     "CAPCameraPlugin",
     "DevicePlugin",
     "FilesystemPlugin", 
     "HapticsPlugin",
     "KeyboardPlugin",
     "PreferencesPlugin",
     "StatusBarPlugin",
     "DialogPlugin",
     "EventPhotoPicker",
     "UploadManager", 
     "PhotoLibraryMonitor"
   ]
   ```

3. **Swift plugin classes** kept as simple CAPPlugin inheritance:
   ```swift
   @objc(EventPhotoPicker)
   public class EventPhotoPicker: CAPPlugin {
       override public func load() {
           super.load()
           NSLog("üéØ EventPhotoPicker plugin loaded successfully!")
       }
       
       @objc func openEventPhotoPicker(_ call: CAPPluginCall) {
           // Implementation...
       }
   }
   ```

**Key Insights:**
- **Both Android and iOS need bridge files** for Capacitor plugin registration
- **Android:** Java bridge files 
- **iOS:** Objective-C .m bridge files with CAP_PLUGIN macros
- **packageClassList** is required for Capacitor to discover custom plugins
- **CAPBridgedPlugin** approach caused app hanging - stick to simple CAPPlugin + .m files

### **Capacitor Plugin Registration Requirements**

**For iOS Custom Plugins, you need:**
1. ‚úÖ **Swift implementation file** (e.g., `EventPhotoPicker.swift`)
2. ‚úÖ **Objective-C bridge file** (e.g., `EventPhotoPicker.m`) with `CAP_PLUGIN` macro
3. ‚úÖ **Plugin listed in packageClassList** in `capacitor.config.json`
4. ‚úÖ **Plugin configuration in plugins section** of `capacitor.config.json`

**Correct capacitor.config.json structure:**
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "EventPhotoPicker": {},
    "UploadManager": {},
    "PhotoLibraryMonitor": {}
  },
  "packageClassList": [
    "EventPhotoPicker",
    "UploadManager", 
    "PhotoLibraryMonitor"
  ]
}
```

### **Build Process Issues (RESOLVED)**

**Problem:** Build failed with "Build input file cannot be found" errors for .m files.

**Solution:** 
1. Ensure .m files exist in correct location (`ios/App/App/`)
2. Run `npx cap sync ios` to update Xcode project references
3. Verify files are included in Xcode project Sources build phase

**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Sync Capacitor configuration
npm run ios:sync

# Run iOS app 
npm run ios:run

# Open in Xcode for debugging
npm run ios:open
```

### **JavaScript Integration Working**

**Event Info Button Location:** The Event Info button is created in `photo-share-app-integration.js` in the `addEventInfoDisplay()` function (lines 1112-1141).

**Script Loading Order:**
- App loads `photo-share-app-integration.js` locally
- Website loads same script from `/js/photo-share-app-integration.js`
- EventPhotoPicker should now be available in `window.Capacitor.Plugins.EventPhotoPicker`

**Testing Commands:**
```javascript
// Check if plugin is available
console.log('üîç Available plugins:', Object.keys(window.Capacitor?.Plugins || {}));

// Test EventPhotoPicker directly
window.Capacitor?.Plugins?.EventPhotoPicker?.showEventInfo({
  eventName: "Test Event",
  eventId: "test-123", 
  memberId: "test-user",
  startDate: "2025-08-22T10:00:00Z",
  endDate: "2025-08-22T18:00:00Z"
});
```

### **Phase 1 Status: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

The following Phase 1 items are now completed:
- ‚úÖ **UploadManager.swift plugin created** with basic structure
- ‚úÖ **Plugin registered in iOS** with proper .m bridge file
- ‚úÖ **Plugin available in JavaScript** as `window.Capacitor.Plugins.UploadManager`
- ‚úÖ **Integration with EventPhotoPicker** possible via plugin communication
- ‚úÖ **No crashes or errors** in plugin registration

**Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Basic Upload Queue & Task Management**
